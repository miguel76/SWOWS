/* Implementation note: Jeremy Carroll
 * 
 * Use of CopyOnWriteArray is unnecessarily inefficient, in that
 * a copy is only needed when the register or unregister
 * is concurrent with an iteration over the list.
 * Since this list is not public we can either make it private
 * or provide methods for iterating, so that we know when
 * it is necessary to copy the array of listeners and when it 
 * isn't.
 * This is a fair bit of code, and would need either a lock or
 * an atomic integer or something from the concurrent package.
 * Until and unless the high cost of registering and unregistering
 * is an issue I think the current code is elegant and clean.
 * In practice, most graphs have no more than 10 listeners
 * so the 10 registrations take 55 word copy operations - nothing
 * to get upset about.
